Description:knnAUC : k-nearest neighbors AUC test.Testing dependence/correlation of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics.In this work, we proposed a new way of testing nonlinear dependence between one continuous variable (X) and one binary variable (Y).We addressed this research question by using R package 'knnAUC'.In the knnAUC framework, we first calculated the AUC estimator based on a k-nearest neighbors classifier, and then evaluate the significance of the AUC based statistic (Alternative hypothesis: AUC > 0.5, that is to say, X has prediction power for Y).
